## libft 

Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

It must be done in accordance with the [**`Norme`**](https://github.com/andreevgy/42-norme-ru) (the rules of coding style).
